    "firstText": "The most sustainable building is one that is never built. The second most sustainable building is one that leaves no damage and is returned to biological or technical cycles after its use.",
    "secondText": "We set ourselves the task of building N.O.W. Lindow, which consists mainly of biological materials, in order to make a positive contribution to the necessary turning point in construction. Due to their reusability and recyclability, the remaining materials form a material bank and thus close the technical cycle of circularity. In this way, all components are able to be (re)used in a wide variety of ways until they have reached their individual lifespan and create ecological and economic added value in the next life cycle step.",
    "thirdText": "However, during the use phase, pollution prevention is equally important. The concept of N.O.W. Lindow goes further than its shell and is functionally integrated into its surroundings following the spirit of Permaculture. Thus, it plays an important role as a provider and user of resources on the small garden.",
    "fourthText": "Social sustainability and affordability are also essential criteria that should enable people to build their own healthy home. N.O.W. Lindow proposes a building form that uses affordable local materials and makes co- building possible and combines these principles in order to create a home rather than a property.",
